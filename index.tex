\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Title : \textbf{Lost and Found}
\item Problem Statement \\
\tabto{.5cm}Existing lost and found management systems suffer from fragmentation and
inefficiency due to their reliance on outdated methods such as physical notice
boards and disparate online platforms. This lack of a centralized and accessible
platform hinders the timely and effective reporting of lost items by users and found
items by finders. Consequently, individuals experiencing loss and those who have
found items encounter difficulties in navigating the process, resulting in prolonged
periods of uncertainty and decreased chances of successful item recovery.\\
\tabto{.5cm} Our project aims to address the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional lost and found systems by developing a user-friendly, single-page web application designed to manage lost and found items.
\item Solution approach \\
\tabto{.5cm}Our proposed exam evaluation system will streamline the examination process, from creation to evaluation, ensuring accuracy and security. Below are the key features and functionalities.

\item MySQL or a similar relational database management system (RDBMS) is used for efficient data management.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Notifications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated notifications inform students about exam schedules and results.
\item Alerts are sent via email or SMS for timely updates.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\item Does any other solution already exist for the stated problem? If yes, give details.
\begin{itemize}
\item Yes, there are existing solutions for exam evaluation, but they often suffer from various limitations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Manually Conducted Exams
\begin{itemize}
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time-Consuming: Teachers must manually check each system for output verification, which is inefficient.  
\item No Proper Partial Output Verification: Results are assessed as correct or incorrect, without acknowledging partial correctness.  
\item System Variability: Each system may behave differently due to inconsistent configurations, causing discrepancies in output.  
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Online Exam Platforms
\begin{itemize}
\item HackerRank
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item No Partial Output Detection: Unable to evaluate partially correct solutions, which is essential for fair assessment in coding exams.  
\item Not Best for College Lab Exams: The platform is better suited for corporate hiring assessments than for educational settings.  
\item Limited Offline Support: Requires constant internet connectivity, which can be a challenge for some labs.  
\end{itemize}
\item HackerEarth
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item High Cost: Not affordable for all educational institutions.  
\item Complex Setup: Requires significant technical expertise for exam creation and management.  
\end{itemize}
\item Other Online Platforms
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lack of AI Features: Many do not offer advanced features like AI-based partial output evaluation.  
\item Limited Customization: Few platforms allow fully tailored exams to suit specific academic needs.  
\item Proctoring Gaps: Some platforms have limited proctoring features, increasing the risk of cheating.  
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item A centralized, AI-powered exam evaluation system with robust proctoring, partial output detection, and seamless integration for college labs can effectively address these limitations.
\end{itemize}
