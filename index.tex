\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Title : \textbf{Lab Exam Management System}
\item Problem Statement \\
\tabto{.5cm}Current lab exam systems are inefficient and lack functionality tailored to programming assessments. Teachers face challenges in creating and managing exams for specific groups, while students struggle with inconsistent tools for writing and testing code.
The absence of a centralized platform complicates processes like code evaluation, test case validation, and reporting. Limited feedback mechanisms and manual report generation hinder efficiency and fairness.

A dedicated lab exam management system is needed to enable teachers to create online programming exams, provide students with an integrated code editor for writing and testing, evaluate submissions based on test case correctness, and use AI for partial evaluation. It should also streamline report generation, ensuring accurate and efficient assessments.\\

\item Solution approach \\
\tabto{.5cm}Our proposed exam evaluation system will streamline the examination process, from creation to evaluation, ensuring accuracy and security. Below are the key features and functionalities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{User Registration and Authentication}
\begin{itemize}
\item Users can join as a student or teacher by creating accounts or logging in using existing credentials.
\item Authentication ensures secure access to the system.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Room Creation and Exam Setting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Examiners can create exam rooms and upload question papers.
\item Features include specifying exam dates and durations.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Platform-Independent compiler and Proctored UI}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system includes a platform-independent compiler interface for seamless access on any device.
\item A proctored UI prevents students from copying or switching tabs during the examination.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{AI Partial Output Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item An AI-powered module evaluates student's code for partial correctness.
\item This ensures fair grading even if the solution is incomplete but correct to some extent.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Student-Wise Report Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system generates detailed results for each student.
\item Results can be downloaded in PDF format for easy sharing and record-keeping.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Centralized Database}
\begin{itemize}
\item A centralized database stores information about exams, subjects, dates, and student reports.
\item MySQL or a similar relational database management system (RDBMS) is used for efficient data management.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Notifications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated notifications inform students about exam schedules and results.
\item Alerts are sent via email or SMS for timely updates.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\item Does any other solution already exist for the stated problem? If yes, give details.
\begin{itemize}
\item Yes, there are existing solutions for exam evaluation, but they often suffer from various limitations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Manually Conducted Exams
\begin{itemize}
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time-Consuming: Teachers must manually check each system for output verification, which is inefficient.  
\item No Proper Partial Output Verification: Results are assessed as correct or incorrect, without acknowledging partial correctness.  
\item System Variability: Each system may behave differently due to inconsistent configurations, causing discrepancies in output.  
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Online Exam Platforms
\begin{itemize}
\item HackerRank
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item No Partial Output Detection: Unable to evaluate partially correct solutions, which is essential for fair assessment in coding exams.  
\item Not Best for College Lab Exams: The platform is better suited for corporate hiring assessments than for educational settings.  
\item Limited Offline Support: Requires constant internet connectivity, which can be a challenge for some labs.  
\end{itemize}
\item HackerEarth
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item High Cost: Not affordable for all educational institutions.  
\item Complex Setup: Requires significant technical expertise for exam creation and management.  
\end{itemize}
\item Other Online Platforms
\item {Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lack of AI Features: Many do not offer advanced features like AI-based partial output evaluation.  
\item Limited Customization: Few platforms allow fully tailored exams to suit specific academic needs.  
\item Proctoring Gaps: Some platforms have limited proctoring features, increasing the risk of cheating.  
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item A centralized, AI-powered exam evaluation system with robust proctoring, partial output detection, and seamless integration for college labs can effectively address these limitations.
\end{itemize}


\item In what way is your proposed solution better than the existing solution(s)?\\
\tabto{.5cm}Our proposed solution for online examination management offers several advantages over existing methods.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Advanced Anti-Cheating Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most platforms, including ETLab, focus on online proctoring or basic monitoring methods, which can often be bypassed.
\item Our proposed application incorporates robust anti-cheating measures such as tab-locking technology, real-time notifications for unauthorized activity, and automatic banning for rule violations, ensuring a secure and fair examination environment, even in offline settings.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Centralized Timing Mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application utilizes a centralized API to synchronize the start time for all participants.
\item This ensures a uniform experience and eliminates timing-related issues.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Comprehensive Result Table Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application automatically generates a detailed PDF report with comprehensive analytics, including individual and group performance metrics.
\item Faculty can quickly assess outcomes without manual intervention.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{AI-Driven Feedback for Students}
\begin{itemize}
\item Other platforms lack personalized insights into students' weak areas and improvement strategies.
\item Our application uses AI to analyze performance and provide targeted suggestions for improvement, empowering students with actionable insights for skill enhancement.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Uniform Coding Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Other platforms may allow students to use their preferred compilers, which can lead to inconsistencies in results.
\item Our application ensures all students use the same compiler, maintaining uniformity in coding environments and evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Post-Exam Solution Access}
\begin{itemize}
\item Facilitates faculty to upload correct answers.
\item Students can review and self-evaluate their performance after the exam.
